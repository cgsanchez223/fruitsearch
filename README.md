Welcome to the Fruit Search Project where you can search for fruit.

This project was created for the Software Engineering bootcamp at Stony Brook University.

The purpose of this project is to study predictive text.
- We are given an array containing a list of fruits
- We had to write a program that listened for key inputs and perdicted written text based on the array of fruit items.
- We used a search bar to accept a string text that will be matched up with the array string
- We wrote 2 suggestion functions which handle matching up input with word list, and removing suggestions once they do not meet criteria.
- Once a keyword is clicked, it will be shown on the search bar and all other suggestions will disappear.

Project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- CSS styling included hover and highlighting functions when clicking on a suggested word.
- Some fruits had icons, taken from what is available on VS Code
